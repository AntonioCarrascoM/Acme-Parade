Regarding the past deliverable (D01 - Introduction):

We did not mention an assumption that we did about the project: The very first day of project work we talked with our teacher (José Gonzalez (Pepe)) about what we had planned with the relationship between Brotherhoods, floats and processions (they were still processsions at that point) and, to sum it up, he told us that in real life, there were some cases of processions that existed without a float so that is the reason why we decided to make them optional for a procession.
Sorry for being late with this note but since we are still on a very similar project we thought that trying to clarify it would be the best thing for us. Again, sorry for the inconvenience.

Regarding the actual deliverable (D02 - Functional testing):

We asked our theory teacher (Carlos Müller) on 22nd of March at 11:40 or so about a problem that we had when planning the deletion of an actor. We asked him if we could instead do a logical deletion (disabling this account but not deleting it from the database, so it would be deleted to the eyes of the user) to avoid all the problems with entities pointing at the instance that was being deleted since in most of the cases with actors, they were not optional and we would need to change the entire model relationships and some attributes like sender/recipient in the messages. So if any actor presses the "Disable account" button he will flag himself as "inactive" and log out immediately. After that, he won't be able to log in anymore.
